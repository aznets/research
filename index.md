## Research

### <span style="color:orange"> Research Interest  </span>

My primary research interests are in developing predictive modeling, diagnostic application, and analytic methods with the quantitation of multi-dimensional medical fusion imaging data using machine learning, deep learning, and advanced statistical methods.

My current research have been involved in decoding tumor phenotype with Radiomics approach such as the extraction and analysis of advanced high througput quantitative imaging features obtained from CT, PET or MRI to build predictive models for patients' outcome.
